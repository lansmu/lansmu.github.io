<button class="accordion">Summary of Findings</button>
<div class="finding">
 	<p>From the User research and the user testing, I realized that building up a personal portfolio is not only about putting things together, but also need to consider about all the user experience, including deciding which information the users want to see and how to make layout more concise and useful. In the beginning of the quarter, we did the user research, from the user interviews I found those people who are not very familiar with the portfolio design has less limits to think about what they want to see. Sometimes designers would restrict themselves to a stereotype and could not come up with good ideas, but during the interviews, I can see some brilliant ideas from other users and get great feedback to improve my work.<br><br>

	During the user testing, viewers can actually see my half-done portfolio and give me intuitional perspectives. Nowadays people view websites a lot, so my testing provided me lots of useful information to let me know people care more about the work experience in my case, and the contact methods for the convenience. <br>
	
	Overall, the user research and user testing help me a lot to see my weakness of my portfolio and figure out what I need to improve it. I received many useful advice from my friends from different fields, even though they are not experts in web developing, they provide diverse points of view to shape what a successful portfolio is. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Incorporation of Findings</button>
<div class="finding">
  	<p>At the beginning phase of developing my portfolio, since I do not have any experience using HTML, css and javascript, I do not have strong basic skills to even think of something that I want to do, so I put everything in an easiest way to fulfill my goal. For example, I just write down my email address and phone number on my home page to let my viewers see them. But from the user interviews, the interviewees let me realize that I need more professional and convenient ways to let viewers contact me, such as the social media pages. So I did some research and figured out how to add social media icons into the portfolio and linked those icons to my social media pages. <br><br>

  	Next, all viewers think that the work experience and skills should be the most important part in my portfolio because that part really shows my personal strength. So I adjusted my timeline to emphasize my work experience and skills. Even though I do not have many, I still want to show them as my profession. What's more, I am planning to change my navigation bar into more smooth and stylish way, rather than right now I only have it like a three buttons upon my pages. </p>
